# Introduction

## **Overview of Playback Experiments**[@noad2017][@derosa2021]

Playback experiments are a cornerstone of behavioral research, enabling controlled manipulation of sensory stimuli to investigate animal communication, cognition, and social behavior. By presenting recorded signals—acoustic, visual, or multimodal—to subjects, researchers can infer the function and meaning of signals, test hypotheses about perception and cognition, and assess behavioral responses in both natural and controlled environments. Applications span avian territoriality, primate communication, predator recognition, and human-computer interaction, underscoring their versatility and significance in experimental biology and psychology.

## **Rationale for Comparing Data Collection Methods**[@suri2025][@mercermoss2015][@fischer2013]

The choice of data collection method in playback experiments is pivotal, influencing not only the quality and reliability of the data but also the efficiency and validity of the experimental outcomes. Systematic comparison is necessary because:

-   Data quality and time efficiency are directly affected by the method and platform used.

-   Methodological rigor (e.g., protocol adherence, observer blinding) determines the validity and reproducibility of findings.

-   Technological advances and the rise of online/automated platforms introduce new opportunities and challenges for data collection.

......However, while individual studies often acknowledge these methodological constraints, there has been no systematic synthesis quantifying how data collection methods impact the overall efficiency of playback-based research in birds.

This meta-analysis aims to address this gap by evaluating how different data collection approaches influence the outcomes, reliability, and interpretability of avian acoustic playback experiments. By comparing methodological features across published studies, we assess which practices enhance experimental efficiency and which introduce predictable sources of variation. Our findings provide a foundation for improving experimental design, increasing reproducibility, and guiding best practices for future research in avian bioacoustics.
